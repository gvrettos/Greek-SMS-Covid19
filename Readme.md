This application is developed because the Greek Government announced a two week lockdown.
 The user can use the app, as long as he/she provides his/her name and address.
 All of the information is only stored on your mobile phone, nothing is forwarded on any server.
  Since the name and address will be the same in every SMS, this application will let the users
   set up their data, and only select the option each time regarding their movement, like super-market, pharmacies etc.
